There were water and sewer work on Nutting Road in 2022, but from what I can tell, the city did not go through the public/private split and ARPA funds were used. This is because the city owns the infrastructure underneath the street. There are some paving and sidewalks costs associated with the bid, but they seem to entirely be on the public section of Lake St or patching excavation that was done.

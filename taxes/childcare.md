Childcare facilities are taxed at the residential rate, something I haven't observed for any other type of business.

While perhaps appropriate for childcare run out of residential properties, there are a few in commercial buildings:

- 176 Second Ave - Assessed Value 2,182,300 - Residential Value 2,182,300- $25,380.15 in "missing" revenue
- 475 Winter St - Assessed Value 13,605,100 - Residential Value 3,260,044 - $37,914.31 in "missing" revenue
- 295 Weston St - Assessed Value 2,287,900 - Residential Value 1,143,950 - $13,304.14 in "missing" revenue
- 169 Elm St - Assessed Value 1,523,700 - Residential Value 1,371,350 - $15,948.80 in "missing" revenue

The tax data site is down when I write this, so the portion taxed at the residential rate is from memory.

There may be a few more buildings I haven't found yet, but this is about $92,000 every year. That could do a lot of good, perhaps something to keep that money in childcare support. I can understand keep this exception for childcare run out of primary residents, but some of these commercial childcare facilities have centers across New England and are publicly traded companies.

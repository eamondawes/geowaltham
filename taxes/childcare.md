Childcare facilities are taxed at the residential rate, something I haven't observed for any other type of business.

While perhaps appropriate for childcare run out of residential properties, there are a few in commercial buildings:

- 176 Second Ave - Assessed Value 1,995,500 - 100% residential rate - $22,828.52 in "missing" revenue
- 475 Winter St - Assessed Value 13,136,200 - ~40% residential rate - $60,111.25 in "missing" revenue
- 275 Weston St - Assessed Value 2,047,300 - ~50% residential rate - $23,421.11 in "missing" revenue
- 196 Elm St - 1,393,400 - ~85% residential rate - $13,549.42 in "missing" revenue

The tax data site is down when I write this, so the portion taxed at the residential rate is from memory.

There may be a few more buildings I haven't found yet, but this is about $120,000 every year. That could do a lot of good, perhaps something to keep that money in childcare support. I can understand keep this exception for childcare run out of primary residents, but some of these commercial childcare facilities have centers across New England and are publicly traded companies.

A bunch of GIS based projects about Waltham, finding me on Twitter @eamondawes is the best way to reach out

## Private Ways
Waltham has a bunch of private ways and it causes lots of headaches for neighbors and abutters. 

In 2015 we put out to bid this work to identify public and private ways. From what I can tell, no bids were submitted, but it has one of the last up to date records of private ways in the city:

The GIS data also shows private ways by identifying polygons with a POLY_TYPE equal to PRIV_ROW. You can find this data in the raw/LS_SHP_M308_Waltham/M308TaxPar_CY22_FY22 shapefile.

I compiled both of these into a list of private ways which I belive is fairly accurate in its conclusions or lack thereof.

The Waltham ward map is a good resource for a current index of streets, but it is a few years out of date, mostly on wards and precints.
